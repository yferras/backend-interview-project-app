* Main target

Implement a REST API in Java with data persistency and caching to fulfill the
basic requirements of a Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) platform.

** Introduction

A Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) platform helps IT professionals manage
a fleet of Devices with Services associated with them. This Web Service will
fulfill the most basic requirements of an RMM by keeping a simple inventory of
Devices and Services to calculate their total costs.

Breakdown of Service costs by Device Type:

#+caption: Services and costs
#+name: tbl:services_cost_per_device_type
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Type                  | Price         |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Device of any type    | $4 per device |
| Antivirus for Windows | $5 per device |
| Antivirus for Mac     | $7 per device |
| Backup                | $3 per device |
| Screen Share          | $1 per device |
|-----------------------+---------------|

Devices have the following properties:
- Id
- System Name
- Type (Windows Workstation, Windows Server, Mac, etc.)


** Requirements

1. Implement a simple data model and persistence for Devices and the Services
   associated with them.
2. Implement endpoints and logic for the following.
   - Add, Delete (no edits) for Devices. Duplicate Devices should not be
     allowed.
   - Add, Delete (no edits) for Services and their cost. Duplicate Services
     should not be allowed.
   - Add, Delete (no edits) for Services assigned to a Device.
   - Calculate the total cost of the services depending on Services used by a
     Device.

     *Example*:
     Customer with 2 Windows and 3 Macs, with the following Services:

     |-------------+-----------+--------+--------------|
     | Device Type | Antivirus | Backup | Screen Share |
     |-------------+-----------+--------+--------------|
     | Windows     |         2 |      1 |            2 |
     | Mac         |         3 |      2 |            2 |
     |-------------+-----------+--------+--------------|
     | *Total ($)* |   *31.00* | *9.00* |       *4.00* |
     |-------------+-----------+--------+--------------|
     *Total Cost:* $64

     Explanation:
     |--------------+----------|
     | Category     | Cost ($) |
     |--------------+----------|
     | Devices      |    20.00 |
     | Antivirus    |    31.00 |
     | Backup       |     9.00 |
     | Screen share |     4.00 |
     |--------------+----------|

3. Implement a rudimentary cache for the calculation per device. Note that the
   cache must be re-evaluated any time a service is added to a Device.
